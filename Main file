QUESTION 175-- COMBINING THE TWO TABLES
To combine two tables we use the joins function, in this question specifically we will use the left join.
The main difference we are not using full join as we have to take values from the table 1 which is the persons tabeel. We can see that there are only 1 common person id 
in the given table but we need to print both the names given in the table so we will use left join. The mysql code is--

select firstname,lastname, city, state
from  Person left join Address
on Person.PersonId = Address.PersonId;


QUESTION 176. SECOND HIGHEST SALARY
In this we have to find the second highest salary in the table which is calculated by using the max function twice.
First we need to find the highest salray and remove it outside , then use the function again which will give the higest salary which will be the second highest salary
The code is as follows--

SELECT MAX(salary) AS SecondHighestSalary FROM Employee WHERE salary NOT IN 
( SELECT MAX(salary) AS max_salary FROM Employee)
