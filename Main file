QUESTION 175-- COMBINING THE TWO TABLES
To combine two tables we use the joins function, in this question specifically we will use the left join.
The main difference we are not using full join as we have to take values from the table 1 which is the persons tabeel. We can see that there are only 1 common person id 
in the given table, but we need to print both names in the table so we will use left join. The mysql code is--

select firstname,lastname, city, state
from  Person left join Address
on Person.PersonId = Address.PersonId;


QUESTION 176. SECOND HIGHEST SALARY
In this, we have to find the second highest salary in the table which is calculated by using the max function twice.
First, we need to find the highest salary and remove it outside, then use the function again which will give the higest salary which will be the second highest salary
The code is as follows--

SELECT MAX(salary) AS SecondHighestSalary FROM Employee WHERE Salary NOT IN 
( SELECT MAX(salary) AS max_salary FROM Employee)


QUESTION 177. Nth Highest Salary
In this, we have to find the nth highest salary in the given table which is an employee, salary table.
The code for that is given below--

CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
SET N = N-1;
  RETURN (
      SELECT DISTINCT(salary) from Employee order by salary DESC
      LIMIT 1 OFFSET N
      
  );
END



QUESTION 178. RANK SCORES
We have to rank the given table in order of highest to lowest, the question also demanded that the if the two numbers are equal they should be given the same rank.
